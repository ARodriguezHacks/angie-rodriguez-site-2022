With tons of programming languages to choose from, it's difficult to decide why choose one over the others.

What motivates us?
- Social media and industry hype?
- Fear Of Missing Out? (FOMO)
- Feeling like you HAVE to learn that particular language
- And many more...

I usually base my decisions on longevity and what I encountered from reading job descriptions.

And yet...my actual Main reason for learning Rust is because I have an extra incentive to learn it. That incentive is being part of group of learners who have also decided to take the leap and start this Rust learning journey. It was the extra push to decide which programming languge to learn next.

(As of late 2023, I'm also learning TypeScript and Python)

This Rust co-hort is an endeavor within the VirtualCoffee commmunity of developers and tech enthusiasts. I discovered the group a month after my layoff in July 2023 and it's definitely been one of the better communities I've found since becoming a developer in 2019.
